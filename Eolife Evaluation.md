Eolife Evaluation
====================
---

date: "23/11/2020"




Need to know the inspiratory and expiratory flow ranges that physiotherapists generate during physiotherapy interventions that involve manual hyperinflation.

## Procedure 

1. Only patients who would be recivieing MHI as part of their normal treatment.
2. Ideally 3 different physiotherapists for each patient
3. Complete data collection form
3. Decide and record the order of the Physiotherapists carrying out the MHI
4. Attach Eolife into circuit
5. Carry out treatments in the predefined order of Physiotherapist
6. Record the time at which each physiotherapists carries out mhi
7. No sessions with CWV's

## Data to be collected

- Ventilation Mode
- Pressure Support/Pressure Control
- PEEP
- Vt
- Physiotherapist 
- Eolife Vti, flow~insp~, flow~exp~
- Do you think you achieved an expiratory Flow bias/

	
## Analysis

- Mean and sd of Vti, flow~insp~, flow~exp~  by patient grouped by Physiotherapist
- Mean and sd of Vti, flow~insp~, flow~exp~  by Physiotherapist grouped by patient
